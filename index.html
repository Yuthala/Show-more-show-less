                    <p>After the Hurons left, Uncas went and 
                        spoke with Hawkeye.</p>
                    <p>“What does Hawkeye say?” asked 
                        Uncas.</p>
                    <p>“Give me twenty rifles; then you go and 
                        find them, and we will attack them. After 
                        that, we will take the woman from his 
                        cave.”</p>
                    <p>So, twenty warriors were selected, 
                        including David and Duncan, to follow 
                        Hawkeye, and they walked to an area close 
                        to the beaver lodge. Here they would 
                        make the first attack against the Huron. 
                        The two groups left together and went in 
                        their different directions. When Hawkeye 
                        and his men reached the beaver lodge, 
                        they were pleased to see Chingachgook 
                        and Munro join them.</p>
                    <p>The Hurons soon appeared nearby in an 
                        open area. A shout came from Uncas as 
                        he came from the other side of the forest 
                        leading a hundred warriors. Hawkeye and 
                        his men fired at the Huron, and many of 
                        their warriors fell, while some of them 
                        began to run away. </p>
